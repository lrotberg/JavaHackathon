#JavaHackathon

Description: our project's main goal is the ability to run on multiple frameworks: Web (using selenium), Database, Mobile, REST-API, Electron, and Desktop App. 
On each platform, we automatically start the different drivers, we use 'Find by' methods to locate most elements using: basic locators, advanced locators (such as XPath, CSS selector, and sikuli). All of which are manipulated as intended by self-written tests and methods.
Once the Tests are either completed or failed the program is shutting down these different drivers automatically.
By running this project, we check if the given frameworks are working as intended.

Visuals: once one or more of our tests fail, we use a few methods to present them: a video recorder and snapshot. All of which are shown via Allure software.

Installation: to run our project, there are a few programs that are needed: a Java framework such as Intellij. Appium studio to run the mobile app. 
Electron software to run web App. And downloading a few files for opening local ports (grafana-8.2.5.windows-amd64.zip, jenkins.war).

Contributing: we are open to any contributions to improve our project.
